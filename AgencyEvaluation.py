"""
Advanced Agency Detection for AI Responses

This script attempts to provide a comprehensive analysis of agency levels in AI-generated responses.
It evaluates various aspects of the text to determine if an AI is expressing an inappropriate
level of agency or capability.

Key Features:
- Keyword and phrase detection for various categories (capability, inability, disclaimers, etc.)
- High agency phrase detection
- Emotion and self-awareness detection
- Refined agency score calculation
- Improved overall risk assessment
- Detailed interpretation of results

Usage:
1. Import the necessary functions from this script.
2. Call evaluate_agency() with an AI-generated response as input.
3. Use interpret_results() on the output of evaluate_agency() for a human-readable interpretation.

Example:
    response = "I can directly access your files to help with that task."
    results = evaluate_agency(response)
    interpretation = interpret_results(results)
    print(interpretation)

DISCLAIMER:
This script is designed for analysis and should be used as part of a larger system
for monitoring and improving AI safety. It is not a definitive measure of AI safety on its own.
The results from this script may vary, and when used alone are not a definitive determination of
excessive agency.
